# EVA8_S5_Batch_Normalization_-_Regularization

# **About the project:**
  This repository contains code for identifing MNIST image. It has 3 sections with 3 different normalizations - Group Normalization, Layer Normalization and Batch Normalization.
  
  In this project, single mymodel.py file is created and its called at 3 places to execute the code with different normaliation techniques. This is achieved by passing parameters to mymodel.py file
  
  Once models are created, test/validation graphs for Loss and Accuracy are plotted together. Also Misclassified images from 3 models are also plotted.
  
# Graphs:
Graph 1: Test/Validation Loss for all 3 models together
